# azure-resource-graph
## Overview

I am by no means an Azure Cloud expert, but my goal with this project/repo is to document my learnings as I dive into Azure Resource Explorer outside of my daily work.

I welcome any and all feedback because this is centered around giving to the Azue Dev community but as well as documenting learnings.

Feel free to connect with me on these social media platforms:
